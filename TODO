Next things to work on:
 - Network monitor 
 - GtkStatusIcon (only when gnome shell isn't working). Maybe, just maybe.
 - Debug system
 - Handle compile warnings and such messages (-Wall, etc..)
 - Maybe split up code in libtwitux and libtwitux-gtk. Because we're cool like that
 - Check distclean files and distfiles
 - Review m4/ macros. We need to add the gsettings.m4......... i think
