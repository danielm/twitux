About Twitux
--------------------------------------
Twitux was pobably one of the first native twitter-clients for Gnome.
First version was released back in 2007. You can find some of the old
and outdated downloads here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/twitux/files/twitux/

Why Am I trying to resurrect the project?
-------------------------------------
Currently i'm aiming to build up a functional software, with probably
less features then it had back in 0.69 and use the project to get back
into GTK+ development, using all the tools (better ones) we have now.
After that and probably looking forward to 1.0 start adding features.

Things to Find out on my way to 1.0
-------------------------------------
- Use of librest or libsocialweb?. For now librest is my choice since
  libsocialweb seems buggy and Twitter support is broken on my distro.
- Use of Clutter / Mx to build a fancy looking UI. Just maybe,
- Gnome3 - Lots of things changed on Gnome since last release and how
applications interact with it.
- Twitux - Twitter's app name was took by someone :(. (We still have
  the account tho: @twitux)
